## üöÄ About Me
I'm Lokesh.T.R, Freshman, B.Tech. CSE at Vel Tech University.

My journey with coding began at a young age of 13, with a fervent curiosity that led me to self-teach iOS development (Swift), Android development (Kotlin), and web development (React). My passion for exploration extended beyond these core languages, as I ended up learning many other programming languages and frameworks like C / C++, Java, Python, PHP, Laravel, SwiftUI, UIKit, Jetpack Compose, etc. I also learnt quite a lot building good User Interfaces (UI Design) & App Icon Design in my app development journey.

While I haven't embarked on any solo projects yet, I had assisted my father in his freelance work, building apps, websites, web applications and web servers for his clients. This experience provided invaluable exposure to the practical realities of software development and instilled in me the importance of delivering solutions that meet client needs.

Currently, I'm a first-year B.Tech. CSE student at Vel Tech University, eager to delve deeper into the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. Beyond the curriculum, I'm actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to real-world projects.

While my current skillset leans towards mobile and web development, I'm particularly intrigued by the possibilities within AI and Machine Learning. I'm always eager to explore new areas of computer science and expand my knowledge base.

## üçΩÔ∏è What I bring to the table:
 - Strong foundation in iOS, Android, and web development with Swift, Kotlin, and React.
 - Proven ability to learn new languages & frameworks and adapt to different coding environments.
 - Experience collaborating on client projects and delivering results within deadlines.
 - Excellent problem-solving skills honed through personal exploration and academic challenges.

## ü§ùüèª Looking to connect with:
 - fellow developers and programmers to share knowledge and experiences.
 - industry professionals who can provide guidance and mentorship.
 - opportunities to contribute to meaningful projects, potentially through remote internships (20 hours/week).


## ‚ôüÔ∏è My Hobbies:
 - playing Chess.
 - speed-solving a Rubik's Cube.
