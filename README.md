## üöÄ About Me

I'm Lokesh.T.R, Sophomore, B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering at Vel Tech University.

My journey with coding began at a young age of 13, with a fervent curiosity that led me to self-learn various programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, C, Swift, Kotlin, PHP, etc and many tools, libraries and frameworks along the way.

Moreover, I worked for five years in my dad's freelance business where I took on various roles such as iOS App Developer using Swift & SwiftUI, Android App developer using Kotlin and XML Layouts, Flutter and Dart, or Android Webviews and then as a Full Stack Developer specialised in the LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) using the Laravel Framework, Livewire, jQuery & React developing solutions for various clients who run their business in the Kanchipuram Town.

I had participated in Google Summer of Code 2024, an initiative by Google to introduce developers to open source software (OSS) development, and also successfully completed my work with the Swift org., an OSS organisation by Apple primarily focusing on the Swift Programming Language and its ecosystem, under the guidance of my mentors, Alex Hoppen (Developer Tools @ Apple) & Adam Fowler (Swift Server-side Work Group), from the Swift Community. 

Currently, I'm a second-year B.Tech. CSE student at Vel Tech University, eager to delve deeper into the theoretical and practical aspects of computer science. Beyond the curriculum, I'm actively seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to real-world projects.
